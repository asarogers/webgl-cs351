I do not feel like my spiritual life is being nourished enough. Ever since I moved and began this program, my spiritual life has  declined a lot. However, a good thing that has occurred recently is God is sending people into my life that are drawing me back to Him. A result of this is my spiritual life is reigniting, but unlike how it was it the past, being a furnace burning brightly for all to see from miles away, now it's more like a candle that's holding on against blizzard. To the second question, even in the past with a business, a full time job, social obligation such as family and friends, a relationship, while being a full time student, I still found time to attend bible studies, lead bible studies, go to church, read the bible, exercise 6 times a week,  and attend a christian men's group. When I began this program, I'm barely able to attend school full time, maintain my business slightly, and exercise 3-5 times a week.

i believe course correction is definitely needed, I must be better.

Reflection: Why would I need to build more small moments of autonomy and fulfillment into my present life when I am already doing things I love? Example: My business is in software development, which is a task I love wholeheartedly. I am able to exercise often and learn about things I find fascinating. One thing I do miss is boxing and physical exersion in a group session, I miss spending time with my family and I miss being able to hangout with friends without feeling too guilty that I could spend my time being more productive. I know that when I get to the end, which I plan to make that end within the next 5 years, it will be worth it. I know when I finish this program, I truly plan to live out a dream of exploring the US, every state will have some adventure story tied to it. In the moment, I do like to reward myself for achieving little things throughout the week.


3. Well, I wouldn't have the job I have now if not for my grad program. Example, an condition to the job offer I recieved( my literal dream job) is I have to attend school for another year, but it was my senior year when I heard this news, so I had to go to graduate school in order to receive my offer. I decided it would be in something I find interested, which is why I am getting a master in robotics, which is something I wanted to wait until later to do, but decided sacrifices must be made. It enabled me to earn more in the future and gives me the knowledge I want to apply post achieving my fire goal. One thing I know I will do when I graduate, is begin to make a conscious effort to enjoy the present, which may slow down my goals slightly, but they will help me be more human.

Deep Dive:
if I weren't doing this program, I wouldn't have a job offer, so to think of a world in which I am not here is pretty hard. I would definitely be in graduate school, still doing a robotics masters, but at a different university that maybe went slower than it is going now, which wouuld give me more time to bring fulfillment to other parts of my life, but it would slow down another goal I had, which was earning a masters before a certain age and having it before I truly stepped into my career. There is no way to incorporate other actions into my life at this moment. One thing I am really working towards having a profitable year in my business.

A situation with a close friend I felt like I withheld some truth in order to hear him out, allow him to express himself, and be kind. I also did this with another friend, but I hear how frail they sounded at the time. I opt to give them the balanced truths I felt like they most needed to hear at the time, to let them them have the time to feel hear, and told them I would follow back up with them within the week to allow them to get more off their chest.
